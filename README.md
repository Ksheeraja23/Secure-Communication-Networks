# Secure Communication Networks Portfolio
This repository contains the portfolio project for the coursework: Secure Communication Networks, The project focuses on designing a secure and efficient network for a mid-sized company named "Teclyn," which has 150 employees distributed across two floors.

# Project Components
The project contains the following key componenets:

## Network Design
- Detailed network diagram illustrating the layout of the network.
- Justification for design choices, including the selection of hardware and software components.
-Description of the core network infrastructure, including routers, switches, firewalls, and access points.

## Subnetting Scheme
- Explanation of the subnetting strategy used to efficiently allocate IP addresses.
- Division of the /16 network into /24 subnets for improved management and security.

## Network Simulation
-Simulation of the network using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Connectivity testing results demonstrating successful end-to-end communication between devices.

## Network Services and Protocols
- Overview of the OSI 7-Layer Model and its application in the network.
- Examples of how various protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.) facilitate data transfer.

## Network Security
- Implementation of VLANs for access control and segmentation of network traffic.
- Use of firewalls and encryption to protect sensitive data and maintain security standards.

## Network Performance
- Strategies employed to enhance network performance and reliability.
- Discussion of potential performance issues and how they are addressed.

## Dependability
- Measures taken to ensure high availability and fault tolerance within the network.
- Implementation of redundant infrastructure and load balancing to minimize downtime.

# Technologies used
## 1. Cisco Packet Tracer
## 2. Networking hardware (Routers, Switches, Firewalls)
## 3. Protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.)

## Conclusion
This portfolio serves as a comprehensive demonstration of the knowledge and skills acquired in secure communication networks, showcasing the ability to design, implement, and secure a network infrastructure for a corporate environment.
